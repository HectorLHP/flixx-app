This includes the most populr movies and TV shows with detail pages, a search box for movies and shows with full pagination and a slider for movies that are currently playing in theaters. The slider uses the [Swiper](https://swiperjs.com/) library.

<h1>USAGE</h1>

Just clone or download and then register for a free API key at [https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api)

Once you get your key, just add it to the api.apiKey value in the global state at the top.

Note: If you are using this as a production project, you should not store this in the client. You can create a proxy server and store your key there.
